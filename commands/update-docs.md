# Update Docs Workflow

Use this workflow whenever code has changed and the project documentation needs to be brought up to date. The agent uses `git` to detect what changed since the last documentation commit, analyses the diff, and updates only the affected docs.

This workflow is **project-agnostic**: it auto-detects the project root and documentation location.

---

## Step 1 — Orient: detect the project

// turbo
Run the following to establish the project root and basic structure:

```bash
# Project root and current branch
git rev-parse --show-toplevel && git branch --show-current

# Last 5 commits (so we can pick the baseline)
git log --oneline -5
```

Then find where the documentation lives:

```bash
# Look for common doc directory patterns
find "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)" -maxdepth 3 -type d \
  \( -name "docs" -o -name "doc" -o -name "wiki" -o -name "pages" \) \
  ! -path "*/.git/*" ! -path "*/node_modules/*" ! -path "*/.venv/*"

# Also check for top-level markdown files
find "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)" -maxdepth 1 -name "*.md" -type f
```

From the results, identify:

- **`$ROOT`**: the git root directory
- **`$DOCS_DIR`**: where the documentation files are (e.g. `docs/src/`, `docs/`, `wiki/`)

If `$DOCS_DIR` cannot be determined automatically, ask the user: **"Where are your documentation files? (e.g. `docs/`, `docs/src/`, or `README.md` only)"**

---

## Step 2 — Find the baseline commit

// turbo
Find the most recent commit that touched the documentation directory:

```bash
git log --oneline --all -- "$DOCS_DIR" | head -5
```

Note the first hash — call it `<baseline>`. This is the last point in time when docs were current.

If no doc commits exist, use the initial commit as baseline:

```bash
git log --oneline --all | tail -1
```

---

## Step 3 — Get the code diff since the baseline

// turbo
First, a compact summary of what changed in source code (not docs):

```bash
git diff <baseline> HEAD --stat -- . \
  ':!'"$DOCS_DIR" ':!*.md' ':!*.rst' ':!*.txt' ':!*.json'
```

If the diff is manageable, get the full diff:

```bash
git diff <baseline> HEAD -- . \
  ':!'"$DOCS_DIR" ':!*.md' ':!*.rst' ':!*.txt' ':!*.json'
```

> **Tip**: If the diff exceeds ~400 lines, analyse it **file by file** using:
>
> ```bash
> git diff <baseline> HEAD -- path/to/file.py
> ```
>
> Focus on: new/deleted classes or functions, changed method signatures, new modules, changed configuration keys, new data files.

## Step 4 — Discover existing documentation structure

Read the documentation files discovered in Step 1. Understand:

- What topics each file covers
- What module/component/concept each file documents
- The writing style (language, heading level, use of code blocks, tables)

Maintain the same style and language as the existing docs when making edits.

---

## Step 5 — Map changes to affected docs

For each changed file or module, determine which documentation file(s) need updating.

**General mapping heuristics** (adapt to the specific project structure):

| Type of code change                            | What to update                                                                              |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| New class or module added                      | Add it to whichever architecture/overview doc covers that layer; update dependency diagrams |
| Class or function deleted                      | Remove or strike from all docs that mention it                                              |
| Method signature / parameter changed           | Update code examples, parameter tables                                                      |
| New config key or environment variable         | Update configuration docs                                                                   |
| New external dependency added                  | Update setup/installation docs                                                              |
| Data schema changed (DB, JSON, Pydantic, etc.) | Update data model docs                                                                      |
| New CLI command or flag                        | Update CLI reference / usage docs                                                           |
| Behaviour change (algorithm, business logic)   | Update design/architecture docs                                                             |
| New test coverage (major new tests)            | No doc update usually needed unless testing guide exists                                    |

---

## Step 6 — Make surgical edits to affected docs

Update **only** the sections that are out of date. Do not rewrite sections that are still accurate.

Edit rules:

- **Add** new items (classes, methods, parameters, config keys) that appeared in the diff
- **Remove or revise** descriptions of things that were renamed, deleted, or refactored
- **Update** flow diagrams, step-by-step pipelines, and tables to reflect new reality
- **Preserve** all sections not touched by the diff — no gratuitous rewrites
- Match the writing style of the existing doc exactly (language, formatting, code fence style)

---

## Step 7 — Summarise changes and optionally commit

After all edits, display a brief summary:

- Which doc files were modified
- What was added / removed / updated in each

Then ask the user: **"文档已更新。是否要将这些改动提交到 Git？(Y/n)"**

If yes, suggest a commit message in the format:

```
docs: update <DOCS_DIR> to reflect changes since <baseline-short-hash>
```

Then run (replace `<DOCS_DIR>` and `<message>` accordingly):

```bash
git add <DOCS_DIR> && git commit -m "<message>"
```

If no, remind the user that all files are already saved and can be committed later with:

```bash
git add <DOCS_DIR> && git commit -m "docs: ..."
```
